## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance and improve the documentation and the underlying framework. If you are interested in contributing, please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth collaboration.

### 1. **How to Contribute**
   - **Fork the repository:** Begin by forking the <a href="https://github.com/eyika" target="_blank">Atom Repository</a> to your GitHub account. This allows you to freely make changes to the documentation or framework without affecting the original project.
   - **Create a new branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch to keep your changes isolated. You can name the branch something relevant, such as `update-security-docs` or `fix-caching-section`.
   - **Make your changes:** Modify the documentation, add examples, or improve existing explanations. Ensure that your contributions follow the project's style and structure for consistency.
   - **Commit your changes:** After making the changes, commit them with a descriptive message. Be clear about what you have changed or added.
   - **Push to your fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - **Create a pull request:** Open a pull request (PR) against the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you have made in your PR, and why they are necessary or useful.

### 2. **Code of Conduct**
   We aim to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please adhere to the following code of conduct:
   - **Be respectful:** Treat all contributors with kindness and respect. Discriminatory language or behavior will not be tolerated.
   - **Provide constructive feedback:** When reviewing pull requests or discussing issues, offer feedback that is helpful, respectful, and focused on improvement.
   - **Be open-minded:** Accept and consider feedback from others, and be open to discussing ideas in a respectful manner.

### 3. **Documentation Standards**
   - **Clarity and Precision:** Ensure that your contributions are clear and easy to understand. Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless necessary, and explain any complex concepts.
   - **Examples:** Where possible, include code examples that demonstrate how to use a specific feature. Examples should be simple, self-contained, and easy to follow.
   - **Formatting:** Use the markdown syntax consistently throughout the documentation. This includes using appropriate headers, bullet points, code blocks, and links.
   - **Accuracy:** Make sure your changes are accurate. If you're adding new information, verify it with the latest source or reference. If unsure, ask questions or seek advice from other contributors.

### 4. **Testing and Validation**
   If you make changes to the framework or codebase itself (not just documentation), please ensure the following:
   - **Unit Testing:** Write or update unit tests for any new functionality. All new features should be properly tested to ensure they work as expected.
   - **Check for Breakages:** Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. Run the full test suite to verify that everything works as expected.
   - **Code Quality:** Adhere to the code quality standards of the project, including proper indentation, variable naming conventions, and code organization.

### 5. **Reporting Issues**
   If you come across any bugs or issues with the documentation or the framework:
   - **Check for existing issues:** Before submitting a new issue, search the existing issues to see if the problem has already been reported.
   - **Provide detailed information:** When reporting an issue, include as much relevant information as possible, such as the steps to reproduce the problem, the expected behavior, and any error messages.
   - **Be specific:** If the issue is related to the documentation, specify which section of the documentation is unclear or incorrect.

### 6. **Acknowledgments**
   - **Thank you to all contributors!** The project is constantly evolving thanks to the efforts of our community. We appreciate your time and effort in helping us improve the framework and documentation.
   - **Special Thanks:** We would like to acknowledge any contributors who have made significant improvements to the project. Recognition is given for those who contribute major features, fixes, or documentation improvements.
